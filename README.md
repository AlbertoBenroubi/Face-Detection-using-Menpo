# Face-Detection-using-Menpo
At this project, Menpo (http://www.menpo.org/) is used for face detection from videos. The python notebook includes code that converts a video into frames, detects faces from these frames and outputs the cropped image, which includes only the detected face. 

By using Menpo the above procedure is implemented in very few lines of codes.
